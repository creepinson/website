# Theo's Website
This website project is made by Creepinson (Theo) and is serving [his website](https://theoparis.com).

This project was created with Typescript, MongoDB, Express, and React. The database we are using is called MongoDB. 

# Plans for the Future
In the future, there may be some exciting ideas that will be part of this project. One of those is Flowtr, which will be multiple things.
One of those things is a kanban/calandar site with Google Calandar integration. Another thing that I plan on adding to Flowtr is a 
developer tool for creating websites with flow-based programming that is really easy to use. I also plan on adding another developer tool,
which is a time tracker similar to Wakatime.
