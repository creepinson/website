Hello, World! This is my workspace setup page.

## Main Desktop PC

I use this computer as my main development/gaming PC. It has Manjaro KDE and Windows 10 Pro installed in dual-boot mode.

## Old Mac Development Laptop

I use this mac laptop that runs macOS Catalina for school projects in my living room or for browsing the web. I also use
it for developing apps for Apple devices, however this laptop tends to overheat a lot.
